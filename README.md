# OOP-Class-Final-Project
This is a game that i have made for my Object Oriented Programming class. Game is made using Java Swing library. Also MVC pattern was used. The idea of the game is that there is a chicken animation that falls vertically on the screen whilst trying to avoid cats of different levels. At the same time user needs to collect points by hitting breads with the eggs that comes out of chicken. If the user collects enough points, he/she passes to the next level if not plays the same level. There are 3 levels in total. Also chicken dies if it collides with cats.
